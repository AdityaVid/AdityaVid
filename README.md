## Featured Projects

### [AI capstone - AI-Driven Molecular Representation Learning]

- Help research and develop novel graph augmentation techniques for predicting molecular properties
- Developed Probabilistic Edge Pertubarion inspired by Laplace Edge Perturbation
- Help test and evaluate multiple downstreamed finetuneing tasks based on weights from the pretrained models
- Tried to beat baseline's prediction accuracy, but not more than 0.98%

 PyTorch, RDKit, Weights & Biases, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

### [Library Database Management Systema]


- Comprehensive Book Management: Developed a system to Insert, Borrow, Search, Update, Database with each transaction
- Penalty Checking: Implemented a feature to check penalties and overdue fees associated with borrowed books
- User-Friendly CLI: Designed a Command-Line Interface for easy user interaction, with robust Error Handling
- Built a RESTful API for a student portal application using Python and Flask, achieving 95% test coverage through comprehensive unit and integration testing.

### [Real-Time Text Translation App]

Worked on backend for testing different LLM models for faster language translation, as well as build a UI using React

- Built Transformers, RNNs, Encoder/Decoder networks
- Experimented with different word embedding techniques: GloVe and Word2Vec
- Researched and optimized tokenization/embedding techniques for multilingual LLMs
- Created various test cases to test different models using internal and external cross validation
- Was able to increase tranlation times by 12% and app loading times by 4%
- Developed a React-based UI for real-time translation models
